A real-time visualization of air quality in U.S. cities. The visualization pulls data from federal sensors across the United States and reports it in an intuitive, map-based user interface. This tool has been developed to empower users to understand their air quality, so that they can take action to improve it. The visualization collects data about two key pollutants: PM 2.5 and Ozone.
